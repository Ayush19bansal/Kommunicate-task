# Project Description
Weather Application Overview
This React application provides real-time weather information based on the user's location. It utilizes geolocation to fetch current weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The application consists of two main components: Weather and Forecast.
# Weather Component
The Weather component fetches and displays current weather data. It automatically detects the user's location using geolocation. If the user permits location access, it retrieves weather data based on the user's coordinates; otherwise, it defaults to a predefined location. The component updates the weather information every 10 minutes to ensure it remains current.

# Forecast Component
The Forecast component allows users to search for weather information in different cities. It fetches weather data based on the provided city name and displays the current weather, including temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed. Additionally, it provides a search functionality for users to query weather information for specific cities.

# Technologies Used
  1.React: The application is built using the React library, which facilitates the creation of interactive user interfaces. <br/>
  2.React Live Clock: This library is utilized to display real-time clock updates within the application. <br/>
  3.React Animated Weather: It provides animated weather icons to enhance the visual representation of weather conditions. <br/>
  4.Axios: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. <br/>
  5.OpenWeatherMap API: The application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain current weather data based on geographic coordinates or city names. <br/>

# Additional Notes
 => The application periodically updates weather data to ensure users receive the latest information. <br/>
 => Users are informed if they deny location access, prompting them to allow location services for accurate weather predictions. <br/>
 => Visual elements, including animated weather icons and loading indicators, enhance the user experience and provide a more engaging interface. <br/>
